## Elevator Pitches

### 30-Second Pitch (General)
"We turn your FreePBX phone system into an AI-powered receptionist that handles calls 24/7. Using OpenAI's advanced voice technology, it can answer questions, schedule appointments, and transfer to your team when needed—just like a human, but it never sleeps, never calls in sick, and costs 75% less. Auto shops, dental practices, and home service companies use it to capture more leads and free up staff for revenue-generating work."

### 60-Second Pitch (Automotive Focus)
"Imagine never missing a customer call again—even at 2 AM when someone needs a tow truck. Our AI voice assistant integrates directly with your FreePBX phone system and handles customer calls naturally, just like talking to a real person.

It can schedule oil changes, dispatch towing requests, answer service questions, and transfer to your team when needed. One of our auto shop customers was losing $3,000 a month in after-hours towing opportunities. Now they capture every call, and their AI assistant has paid for itself five times over in just three months.

The best part? It takes 3 days to set up, integrates with your existing systems, and your customers love it because they get instant service without waiting on hold."

### 90-Second Pitch (Investor/Technical)
"The SMB phone system market is a $12 billion opportunity that's ripe for AI disruption. We've built an open-source voice AI platform that integrates with FreePBX—the most popular business phone system with over 5 million installations worldwide.

Unlike cloud-based AI answering services that cost $3,000-$10,000 per month, our self-hosted solution costs businesses $300-$500 monthly while giving them complete data privacy and control. We leverage OpenAI's Realtime API for natural conversations, combined with intelligent function calling for appointment scheduling, data collection, and smart transfers.

We're targeting four verticals first: automotive services, medical practices, home services, and legal firms—markets with 1.1 million potential customers who need 24/7 phone coverage but can't afford dedicated staff. Our beta customers are seeing 30-50% revenue increases from captured after-hours opportunities and staff efficiency gains.

We're seeking $1.5M to scale sales and marketing, with projected $5M ARR within 24 months based on $500 average contract value and 30:1 LTV:CAC ratio."

### Long Version (300 words)
**Transform Your Business Phone System Into an AI-Powered Customer Service Machine**

FreePBX Voice Assistant is the first truly intelligent phone system for small and medium-sized businesses. By integrating advanced AI directly into your FreePBX infrastructure, we've created a solution that answers calls, understands customer needs, and takes action—all through natural conversation.

**How It Works:**
When a customer calls your business, our AI assistant answers using OpenAI's GPT-4 Realtime API—the same technology powering ChatGPT's voice features. It can have natural conversations, understand context, ask clarifying questions, and complete tasks like scheduling appointments, processing service requests, or providing information about your business.

When the AI determines a call needs human attention, it seamlessly transfers to your team with full context. You can even monitor calls in real-time and step in whenever needed.

**Why It's Different:**
- **Self-Hosted Privacy:** Your call data stays on your servers, not in the cloud
- **Natural Conversations:** No robotic IVR menus or frustrating button-pressing
- **Deep Integration:** Works with your CRM, booking system, and business tools
- **Full Customization:** Tailored to your industry, brand voice, and processes
- **Proven Technology:** Built on FreePBX (5M+ installations) and OpenAI (leader in AI)
- **Remarkable ROI:** Typically pays for itself in the first month

**Perfect For:**
Businesses that need 24/7 phone coverage but can't justify full-time staff costs. Our customers include auto repair shops handling emergency towing calls, medical practices managing appointment scheduling, HVAC companies capturing after-hours service requests, and legal practices qualifying potential clients.

**Results:**
Our customers report 30-50% revenue increases from captured opportunities, 70% reduction in routine call handling time for staff, and significantly improved customer satisfaction scores from instant 24/7 service.

**Get Started:**
Implementation takes 2-3 days. Most businesses are fully operational within a week. Plans start at $297/month with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

## Sales Email Templates

### Email 1: Cold Outreach (Automotive)

**Subject:** How ABC Auto Shop stopped missing $3K/month in after-hours calls

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Business Name] is one of the top-rated auto shops in [City], but I'm curious—what happens when someone needs a tow truck at 11 PM and calls your shop?

Most shops we talk to either miss those calls entirely or pay for an expensive answering service that just takes messages. Meanwhile, customers call the next shop down the line who can help immediately.

We've built an AI voice assistant that integrates with your FreePBX phone system and answers calls 24/7. It sounds completely natural (customers think it's a real person), can schedule appointments, dispatch towing requests, and transfer to your team when needed.

ABC Auto Shop in [Nearby City] was losing an estimated $3,000/month in after-hours towing and emergency services. In their first 90 days with our AI assistant:
- Captured 47 after-hours towing requests ($8,200 revenue)
- Scheduled 112 service appointments automatically
- Freed up their front desk for higher-value work
- ROI: 5.2x in month one

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this could work for [Business Name]? I can show you exactly how it works and what your ROI might look like.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. We're currently offering free implementation ($1,500 value) for the first 5 shops in [City]. Would love to include you if you're interested.

### Email 3: Nurture Sequence - Education

**Subject:** 5 calls your AI assistant can handle (that your staff hates)

Hi [Name],

Quick question: What percentage of your incoming calls are these repetitive questions?

1. **"What are your hours?"** → AI provides current hours, including holidays
2. **"How much does [basic service] cost?"** → AI quotes standard pricing
3. **"Can I schedule an appointment?"** → AI books it instantly
4. **"Where are you located?"** → AI provides address and directions
5. **"Do you handle [specific service]?"** → AI explains service offerings

If you're like most shops, these 5 questions make up 60-70% of your calls.

Here's what that means:
- Your skilled staff is answering the same questions 50+ times a week
- Time they could spend on actual work: ~10 hours/week
- Lost productivity: $400-600/week ($2,000-2,500/month)

**Plus**, when these calls happen during busy times, you either:
- Interrupt work to answer (lost productivity)
- Let them go to voicemail (lost customers)
- Miss them entirely (lost revenue)

Our AI assistant handles all of these automatically, 24/7, while your team focuses on the work that makes you money.

Curious what this would look like for [Business Name]?

Let's talk: [CALENDAR LINK]

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email 4: Re-Engagement (30 Days After Demo)

**Subject:** Following up - [Business Name] + AI assistant

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on the AI voice assistant demo from last month. I know you were interested but the timing wasn't quite right.

Since we last spoke, we've:
- Added direct integration with [POPULAR INDUSTRY SOFTWARE]
- Reduced setup time to under 48 hours
- Launched a referral program ($500 credit for shops you refer)

More importantly, I'm curious if anything's changed on your end? Common reasons shops circle back:
- Lost a big customer due to a missed call
- Staff shortage or turnover
- Busy season approaching and need coverage
- Competitor started offering 24/7 service

If any of these resonate, let's reconnect. I can get you live within a week if timing's better now.

Worth a 10-minute call?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If it's truly not a fit, no worries at all—just let me know so I don't keep bugging you. I appreciate your time either way.

---

### Transition to Demo

"Based on what you've shared, I think our AI assistant could be a great fit for [Business Name]. Here's why:

[Customize based on their pain points—e.g.,]
- You're missing 20-30 calls a week after hours, which we can capture
- Your staff is spending 10+ hours a week on repetitive questions, which we can automate
- You need 24/7 coverage but can't afford night staff, which we provide at a fraction of the cost

The best way to show you how it works is to have you call our live demo. Can you pull out your phone real quick and call this number while we're on the line?"

[Give demo number, walk through test scenarios]

---

### Handling the Demo

"Okay, call [DEMO NUMBER] and let's try a few scenarios:

**First**, say 'I need to schedule an appointment for an oil change.'
[Let them experience it]

**Second**, try 'Can you transfer me to a technician?'
[Let them hear the transfer process]

**Third**, ask it a specific question about your business—something you get asked all the time.
[Let them test custom functions]

What did you think? Does that sound like a real person or a robot to you?"

[Most say "wow, that's impressive" or similar]

---

### Presenting Pricing & ROI

"Let me show you what this would look like for [Business Name].

Based on what you told me:
- You're getting about [X] calls per week
- Roughly [Y]% are after hours
- You estimate you're missing [Z] opportunities per month

Here's the plan I'd recommend:
- [PLAN NAME] at $[PRICE]/month
- Includes [FEATURES]
- Setup takes 3 days
- 30-day money-back guarantee

Now here's the important part—the ROI:

If we capture just [conservative number] of those missed opportunities per month at an average job value of $[amount], that's $[revenue] in new business. The system costs $[price], which means you're netting $[difference] per month, or $[annual] per year.

And that's not even counting the staff time savings—you mentioned your [role] spends [X hours] on phone calls. That's worth another $[amount] in productivity.

Does that math make sense to you?"

---

### Trial Close

"So here's what I'm thinking: This seems like a no-brainer for [Business Name]. You'd get:
- 24/7 phone coverage starting [DATE]
- More revenue from captured opportunities
- Your team freed up to focus on [core work]
- 30-day money-back guarantee if it doesn't work out

Is there anything holding you back from moving forward today?"

[Listen to objections, handle them—see Objection Handling section]

---

### Close

"Great! Here's what happens next:

1. I'll send you the agreement to sign electronically—takes 2 minutes
2. Our implementation team will reach out within 24 hours to schedule installation
3. You'll be live and answering calls with AI by [DATE]
4. We'll monitor closely for the first week to make sure everything's perfect

Sound good? I'll send that agreement over now. What email should I use?"

[Confirm details, send agreement, schedule follow-up]

"Perfect. You're going to love this. Your customers will get better service, your team will have more time, and you'll capture revenue you're missing today. I'll check in with you next week to see how it's going."

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "It's too expensive"

**Response:**
"I understand cost is a concern. Let me ask you this: What's it costing you right now to miss calls?

Based on what you told me, you're missing roughly [X] calls per month after hours. If even 30% of those would have become customers at an average job value of $[Y], that's $[Z] in lost revenue each month.

The system costs $[Price]—so you'd be losing $[Lost Revenue minus Price] every month by NOT having it.

Plus, think about the staff time. Your [Role] is spending [X] hours a week on routine calls at $[Y] per hour. That's $[Z] in productivity you're getting back.

Does that reframe the investment for you?"

**Alternative Angle:**
"What if we started with just after-hours coverage? That's the easiest ROI to prove. You're missing 100% of calls outside business hours right now. We capture those for $297/month. Does capturing an extra $2-3K in monthly revenue for $297 sound expensive?"

---

### Objection 2: "My customers won't like talking to AI"

**Response:**
"I totally get that concern—I thought the same thing before I heard it in action. Can you call this number real quick? [Give demo number]

[After they try it]

Did that sound like a robot to you? Most people we demo to are shocked at how natural it is.

Here's the thing: Your customers don't care if it's AI or human—they care about getting help quickly. Right now, after-hours callers get voicemail. Would they prefer voicemail, or an AI assistant that can actually schedule their appointment or dispatch a tow truck?

And remember, the AI transfers to your team anytime it makes sense. Complex issues still go to humans—the AI just handles the routine stuff.

Plus, we have 30-day money-back guarantee. If your customers hate it, we'll refund everything. But in 18 months, we've had 3 refund requests out of 200+ customers. People love it."

---

### Objection 3: "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Absolutely, I wouldn't expect you to make a decision this big without thinking it through. Can I ask—what specific concerns are you trying to work through?

[Listen to real concerns, address them]

Here's what I'd suggest: Let's get you set up on a trial basis. We'll implement it, you can use it for 30 days, and if it's not working out, you get a full refund.

The way I see it, you've got three options:

**Option 1:** Think about it for a few weeks/months, miss calls during that time
**Option 2:** Move forward now, start capturing revenue immediately, and use the 30-day guarantee as your safety net
**Option 3:** Do nothing and keep losing calls

Which option costs you the least and gives you the most upside?"

---

### Objection 4: "I don't have time to implement this"

**Response:**
"Great news—you don't have to do anything. Our implementation team handles 100% of it.

Here's your total time commitment:
- **Day 1:** 30-minute kickoff call (we gather information about your business)
- **Day 2:** 15-minute test call (you call in and make sure it sounds good)
- **Day 3:** 20-minute training (we show you how to monitor/manage it)

Total: About 1 hour over 3 days.

Compare that to the 10+ hours a week you're currently spending on phone calls, or the time you'll spend hiring and training a new receptionist.

We're actually saving you time starting from week one. Does that work for your schedule?"

---

### Objection 5: "We already have an answering service"

**Response:**
"That's actually pretty common—about 40% of our customers were using an answering service before switching to us.

Can I ask: What does your answering service actually DO when someone calls?

[Usually: "They take messages"]

Right. So customers still have to wait for a callback, and you still have to return all those calls. You're paying $[X]/month for someone to be a fancy voicemail system.

Our AI assistant doesn't just take messages—it actually helps people. It schedules appointments, dispatches towing, answers questions. The call is handled completely without you.

Plus, we're probably half the cost of your current service. What are you paying now?"

[Compare pricing]

"So you'd save $[Difference]/month AND your customers would get better service. Want to see how it compares for a week?"

---

### Objection 6: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"

**Response:**
"That's a fair concern. Here's how we handle it:

**First**, the AI is trained specifically for your business. It knows your services, pricing, policies—everything. It's not guessing.

**Second**, it knows its limitations. If someone asks something it's not 100% sure about, it transfers to your team. It's programmed to be conservative.

**Third**, you can monitor calls in real-time. You'll see transcripts of every conversation, and you can listen to recordings.

**Fourth**, if a mistake does happen, we fix it immediately. We'll adjust the AI's training, update its knowledge, whatever's needed.

The reality is, the AI is probably MORE consistent than humans. It never has a bad day, never forgets something, never gives wrong information because it's tired or distracted.

But here's the safety net: 30-day money-back guarantee. If the AI makes mistakes that you're not comfortable with, we refund everything. Does that give you enough confidence to try it?"

---

### Objection 7: "My business is too unique/complex for AI"

**Response:**
"I love that you said that, because that's exactly what [similar customer] said before they tried it.

Here's what I've learned: The complexity isn't a problem for the AI—it's actually an advantage. The more specific your process is, the better the AI can follow it.

For example, [give relevant industry example with specific process].

The AI doesn't have to handle EVERY situation—just the common ones. Anything unusual or complex, it transfers to your team.

What makes your business unique? Walk me through your specific process."

[Listen, then show how AI can handle it]

"See? The AI can handle steps 1-4, then transfer to you for the custom part. You're still in control of the complexity, but the AI eliminates the routine work.

Want to build a custom demo specific to your process? I can have our team create one for you to test."

## Closing Scripts

### The Assumptive Close

"Okay, based on everything we've discussed, I think the [Plan Name] is the right fit for [Business Name]. I'm going to get the paperwork started—what email should I send the agreement to?"

[If they agree, proceed. If they hesitate, ask: "Is there something I haven't addressed?"]

---

### The Alternative Close

"So we've got two options that make sense for you:

**Option 1:** Professional Plan at $497/month—gets you 3 lines and custom functions
**Option 2:** Starter Plan at $297/month—single line, perfect for testing

Which one feels right to start with? Remember, you can always upgrade after 30 days."

---

### The Urgency Close

"Here's what I'm thinking: We're running a promotion right now where we're waiving the $1,500 implementation fee for the first [X] customers in [City/Industry].

I've got implementation slots available on [DATE] and [DATE]. If you want one of those, we need to get you signed up today. After that, I'm booked out for 3 weeks and you'd have to pay the implementation fee.

Want to grab the [DATE] slot?"

---

### The Takeaway Close

"You know what, [Name]? The more we talk, I'm not actually sure this is the right fit for you right now.

You mentioned [concern], and I want to be honest—if [situation], this might not work as well.

Let me ask you straight up: Is this something you're genuinely interested in moving forward with, or are we just kicking tires?"

[This often causes them to sell themselves and overcome their own objections]

---

### The Summary Close

"Let me make sure I understand what we've agreed on:

✅ You're missing [X] calls per month, costing you roughly $[Y] in revenue
✅ Our AI assistant would capture those calls 24/7
✅ Your team gets [Z] hours back per week to focus on actual work
✅ You're looking at $[ROI] net benefit per month
✅ We implement in 3 days with zero technical work from you
✅ 30-day money-back guarantee if it doesn't work out

Did I miss anything?

[If no]

Great—so what's holding us back from getting you started today?"

---

### The Direct Close

"[Name], I'm going to be direct with you because I respect your time.

This is a no-brainer for your business. You're going to make more money, your staff is going to be happier, and your customers are going to get better service.

We have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there's literally no risk.

Every day you wait is another day of missed calls and lost revenue.

Can we just move forward and get you started?"
