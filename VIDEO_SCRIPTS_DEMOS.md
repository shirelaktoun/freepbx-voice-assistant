**Detailed Script Excerpt (ROI Section):**

```
PRESENTER (with screen share):
"Let's talk about ROI, because this is where it gets really interesting."

[SHOW: ROI Calculator on screen]

"I'm going to walk through a real example. Let's say you're an auto shop that gets about 50 calls per week."

[FILL IN calculator fields]

"Of those 50 calls:
- 30% are after hours (15 calls/week = 60/month)
- You're probably missing 70% of those after-hours calls
- That's 42 missed calls per month"

[CALCULATION appears]

"If your average job value is $150, and even just 40% of those missed calls would have converted..."

[MATH on screen]
42 missed calls × 40% conversion = 17 lost customers
17 customers × $150 = $2,550 lost revenue per month

"That's $2,550 you're leaving on the table every single month."

[SHOW: Cost comparison]

"Now, our Professional Plan costs $497/month.

So your net gain is:
$2,550 captured - $497 cost = $2,053 per month
Or $24,636 per year"

[SHOW: Payback calculation]

"That's a 5.1x ROI, with a payback period of 6 days."

[Click to next slide]

"But wait - we haven't even counted the staff time savings yet..."
