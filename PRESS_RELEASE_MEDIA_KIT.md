## Launch Press Release

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**FreePBX Voice Assistant Launches AI-Powered Phone System for Small Businesses, Helping Customers Capture $2.4M in Previously Lost Revenue**

*Self-hosted AI assistant integrates with FreePBX to handle customer calls 24/7 using OpenAI's GPT-4 Realtime API*

---

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA – November 4, 2025** – FreePBX Voice Assistant, a new AI-powered phone system for small and medium-sized businesses, today announced its official launch following a successful beta program with 200+ businesses. The platform has already helped customers capture over $2.4 million in revenue that would have been lost to missed calls, representing an average ROI of 6.8x for businesses using the service.

Unlike traditional IVR systems that frustrate customers with robotic menus, or expensive answering services that simply take messages, FreePBX Voice Assistant uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Realtime API to conduct natural, human-like conversations that actually help customers—scheduling appointments, dispatching services, answering questions, and seamlessly transferring complex calls to staff when needed.

**The Problem: Small Businesses Lose $72K Annually to Missed Calls**

Research shows the average small business misses 40 calls per month due to after-hours closures, busy staff, or peak-time overload. With 67% of customers refusing to leave voicemail and 92% calling competitors instead, these missed calls translate to approximately $72,000 in lost annual revenue per business.

"Small businesses are caught in an impossible situation," said [CEO Name], CEO and co-founder of FreePBX Voice Assistant. "They can't afford 24/7 staff, answering services are expensive and ineffective, and traditional IVR systems create terrible customer experiences. Meanwhile, they're bleeding revenue to missed calls every single day."

**The Solution: Enterprise AI at Small Business Prices**

FreePBX Voice Assistant bridges this gap by bringing enterprise-grade AI technology to businesses at an affordable price point starting at $297 per month—a fraction of the cost of hiring additional staff or traditional answering services.

The platform integrates seamlessly with FreePBX, the world's most popular open-source business phone system with over 5 million installations worldwide. This integration means businesses can add AI capabilities to their existing phone infrastructure without expensive hardware upgrades or complicated migrations.

Key features include:

- **Natural Conversations:** Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 Realtime API, conversations sound completely natural—95% of callers don't realize they're speaking with AI
- **Intelligent Actions:** Books appointments, processes service requests, collects information, and dispatches services automatically
- **Smart Transfers:** Recognizes when calls need human attention and transfers seamlessly with full context
- **Self-Hosted Security:** Runs on customer infrastructure for complete data privacy and HIPAA compliance
- **Industry Customization:** Tailored solutions for automotive, medical/dental, home services, legal, and other industries
- **24/7 Availability:** Captures after-hours revenue opportunities without night staff

**Real Results from Beta Customers**

Beta customer ABC Auto Repair in Columbus, Ohio, was losing an estimated $3,000 per month in after-hours towing calls before implementing FreePBX Voice Assistant. In their first 90 days:

- Captured 47 after-hours towing jobs worth $8,200
- Automated 112 appointment bookings
- Freed up 15 hours per week of staff time
- Achieved 5.2x ROI in the first month

"The AI paid for itself in the first week," said Mike Thompson, owner of ABC Auto Repair. "Customers don't even realize they're talking to AI—they just know they got help immediately instead of hitting voicemail. We're now capturing emergency calls at 2 AM, 3 AM, whenever, without anyone having to work nights."

Family Dental Group in Phoenix saw even more dramatic results across their three locations:

- Reduced phone hold times from 4.2 minutes to 0.8 minutes
- Automated 70% of appointment scheduling calls
- Increased patient satisfaction scores by 23%
- Saved $35,000 annually through improved efficiency

"Our front desk staff was drowning in phone calls," said Dr. Sarah Chen, practice manager. "Now they can actually focus on patients who are physically in the office. The AI handles routine scheduling better than humans—it never double-books, never forgets to collect insurance information, and is available 24/7."

**Market Opportunity and Growth Plans**

The company is initially targeting four key verticals with high call volumes and significant after-hours opportunity:

1. **Automotive services** (260,000+ businesses in the U.S.)
2. **Medical and dental practices** (250,000+ practices)
3. **Home services** including HVAC, plumbing, and electrical (500,000+ businesses)
4. **Legal practices** (150,000+ firms)

"We're seeing 25-30% month-over-month growth as word spreads," said [CTO Name], CTO and co-founder. "What's remarkable is that 40% of our new customers come from referrals. When businesses see this working for their peers, they want it immediately."

The company projects reaching 1,000 customers and $6 million in annual recurring revenue within 24 months, with plans to expand internationally and add support for additional languages.

**Commitment to Privacy and Open Source**

Unlike cloud-based competitors, FreePBX Voice Assistant offers self-hosted deployment, meaning customer call data never leaves their servers. This approach addresses growing concerns about data privacy and meets HIPAA requirements for healthcare providers.

"Data privacy isn't optional for many of our customers," said [CEO Name]. "Medical practices, legal firms, and privacy-conscious businesses need to know their data stays under their control. Our self-hosted architecture, combined with the open-source FreePBX foundation, means no vendor lock-in and complete transparency."

**Availability and Pricing**

FreePBX Voice Assistant is available immediately with three pricing tiers:

- **Starter:** $297/month (1 line, 1,000 minutes)
- **Professional:** $497/month (3 lines, 2,500 minutes)
- **Enterprise:** $997/month (10 lines, 5,000 minutes, white-label option)

All plans include free implementation, 30-day money-back guarantee, and no long-term contracts.

## Press Coverage Examples

### Sample Article Pitches

#### Pitch 1: Trade Publication (Automotive Service)

**Subject:** Story Idea: How AI Phone Assistants Are Revolutionizing After-Hours Towing

**Pitch:**
I wanted to share an interesting trend we're seeing in the automotive service industry: shops using AI phone assistants to capture after-hours towing revenue they were completely missing before.

We recently worked with ABC Auto Repair in Columbus, which was losing an estimated $3K/month in after-hours calls. After implementing our AI assistant, they captured $8,200 in towing revenue in just 90 days - all from calls that used to go to voicemail.

This isn't an isolated case. Across 50+ auto shops using our system, we're seeing an average of $2,500/month in captured after-hours revenue.

The interesting angle: Customers don't even realize they're talking to AI. They just know they got help at 2 AM instead of voicemail.

Would this be interesting for [Publication]? I can connect you with shop owners seeing these results, provide audio of actual AI calls, and share data on the broader trend.

Happy to discuss!

[Name]

#### Pitch 2: Business/Tech Publication

**Subject:** Story Idea: SMBs Using AI to Capture $72K in Lost Annual Revenue

**Pitch:**
While everyone talks about AI replacing jobs, there's a quieter revolution happening: SMBs using AI to capture revenue they were losing completely.

Research shows the average small business misses 40 calls/month - representing ~$72,000 in lost annual revenue. Traditionally, their options were expensive (hire more staff for $45K+) or ineffective (answering services that just take messages).

AI phone assistants are changing this equation. At $300-500/month, businesses are seeing 6-10x ROI by capturing previously missed calls.

The data is compelling:
- 200+ businesses using these systems
- $2.4M in revenue captured collectively
- Average ROI: 6.8x
- 97% customer satisfaction

The story angle: This isn't about replacing workers - it's about SMBs competing with larger companies by using enterprise technology at SMB prices.

I can provide:
- Interviews with 5+ business owners
- Before/after financial data
- Audio of actual AI conversations
- Trend analysis and market projections

Interested in exploring this?

### Sample Quote Library (for Quick Media Response)

**On AI replacing jobs:**
> "AI isn't replacing humans in our system—it's handling the repetitive tasks humans hate, so staff can focus on work that actually requires human expertise. We've seen zero job losses among our customers; instead, we see happier, more productive teams."

**On customer acceptance:**
> "95% of callers don't realize they're speaking with AI until we tell them. They just know they got instant help instead of voicemail or endless hold times. The conversation quality has reached a point where it's indistinguishable from human interaction for routine tasks."

**On SMB technology adoption:**
> "Small businesses have been underserved by technology for decades. Enterprise solutions are too expensive and complex; consumer solutions lack the features they need. We're bringing enterprise-grade AI to SMBs at prices they can actually afford."

**On privacy and self-hosted:**
> "Privacy isn't optional for medical practices, legal firms, and other businesses handling sensitive information. Our self-hosted architecture means their data never leaves their servers. No cloud provider has access, no third party can breach it. That's critical for HIPAA compliance and customer trust."

**On the future of phone systems:**
> "In five years, robotic IVR menus will seem as outdated as fax machines. Customers expect natural conversation, intelligent help, and instant responses. AI makes that possible for businesses of any size."
