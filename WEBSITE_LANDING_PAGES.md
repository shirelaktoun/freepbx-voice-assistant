Frequently Asked Questions

**Accordion Format:**

**Q: What if my customers don't like talking to AI?**
A: 95% of customers don't realize they're talking to AI—it sounds completely natural using OpenAI's GPT-4 Realtime API. And for complex issues, the AI seamlessly transfers to your team. We have a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied.

**Q: How does it integrate with my existing phone system?**
A: We integrate directly with FreePBX using ARI (Asterisk REST Interface). Your existing phone numbers, extensions, and routing all stay the same. Most implementations take 3 days from start to finish.

**Q: What happens if the AI doesn't know the answer?**
A: The AI is trained on your specific business information and knows when it's uncertain. If it encounters a question it can't confidently answer, it transfers to your team with full context of the conversation.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes. Unlike cloud-based solutions, our system is self-hosted on your infrastructure. Your call data never leaves your servers. We're HIPAA-compliant for medical practices and meet strict privacy requirements.

**Q: Can I customize what the AI says and does?**
A: Absolutely. The AI's personality, greeting, functions, and responses are all customizable to match your brand and processes. We work with you during implementation to get it perfect.

**Q: What's included in the setup?**
A: Everything. Installation, configuration, customization, testing, training, and go-live support are all included. You don't pay extra for implementation.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes. No long-term contracts or cancellation fees. Month-to-month billing. 30-day money-back guarantee.

**Q: What makes this different from other AI phone systems?**
A: Three key differences: (1) Self-hosted for complete privacy, (2) Natural conversations using OpenAI GPT-4 (not robotic IVR), (3) Deep integration with FreePBX and your business tools.

## About Page

**URL:** /about

**Hero:**
**Headline:** We're Bringing AI to Small Business Phone Systems
**Subheadline:** Built by telecom engineers who were tired of watching businesses lose revenue to missed calls

---

**Origin Story:**

**The Problem We Saw:**

In 2023, we were consulting with a successful auto repair shop. They had everything going for them—great service, fair prices, loyal customers. But they had one major problem: missed calls.

After 5pm and on weekends, every call went to voicemail. The owner estimated he was losing $3,000-5,000 per month in towing and emergency work.

He couldn't afford 24/7 staff. Answering services just took messages. Traditional IVR systems frustrated customers.

**Then OpenAI Released Their Realtime API:**

We saw the potential immediately. What if we could build an AI assistant that:
- Sounded completely natural (not robotic)
- Actually helped customers (not just took messages)
- Integrated with existing phone systems (not requiring expensive upgrades)
- Was affordable for small businesses (not enterprise-only pricing)

**We Built It:**

Three months later, we deployed the first version at that auto shop. Within 90 days:
- 47 after-hours towing calls captured
- $8,200 in new revenue
- Staff could focus on actual work, not phone calls

The owner called it "the best business decision I've made in 10 years."

**Our Mission:**

Help 10,000 small businesses capture $100 million in lost revenue by bringing enterprise AI technology to SMB phone systems.
