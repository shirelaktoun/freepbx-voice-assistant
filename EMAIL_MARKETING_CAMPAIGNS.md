#### Nurture Email 3: Educational Content (5 Days After Demo)

**Subject:** 5 calls your staff probably hates answering

**Preview Text:** These repetitive calls kill productivity

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: What percentage of your incoming calls are these repetitive questions?

**The 5 Most Common (and Annoying) Calls:**

**1. "What are your hours?"**
- Asked 10-20 times per week
- Takes 30 seconds to answer
- Interrupts actual work

**2. "How much does [basic service] cost?"**
- Staff has to look up pricing
- Customer could get instant answer
- Lost time: 2-3 minutes per call

**3. "Can I schedule an appointment?"**
- Requires checking calendar
- Back-and-forth on availability
- Lost time: 5-7 minutes per call

**4. "Where are you located?"**
- Simple but disruptive
- Could be answered automatically
- Lost time: 45 seconds per call

**5. "Do you handle [service/product]?"**
- Requires knowledge of offerings
- New staff often uncertain
- Lost time: 2-4 minutes per call

**The Hidden Cost:**

If these 5 questions make up just 50 calls per week:
- Time spent: ~3-4 hours/week
- Annual cost: ~$8,000-10,000 in staff time
- Plus: Interruption cost (lost productivity)

**AI Handles All of These Automatically**

Your staff focuses on revenue-generating work.
Customers get instant answers 24/7.
You save thousands in productivity.

#### Nurture Email 5: Last Attempt (14 Days After Demo)

**Subject:** Is this still a priority for [Business Name]?

**Preview Text:** Following up one last time

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up one last time on the AI phone assistant for [Business Name].

I know you were interested after our demo, but timing wasn't quite right.

**Has anything changed?**

Common reasons businesses come back:
- Lost a big customer due to missed call
- Staff shortage or turnover
- Competitor started offering 24/7 service
- Busy season approaching
- Finally have budget approved

If any of these resonate, let's reconnect.

**If timing's better now:**
[Schedule Call] or just reply "Let's talk"

**If it's not a fit:**
No worries at all! Just let me know so I don't keep bugging you. I totally understand.

Either way, I appreciate your time.

Best,
[Sales Rep Name]

P.S. If you ever want to revisit this—even 6 months from now—I'm here. Just reach out.

## Industry-Specific Drip Campaigns

### Automotive Industry 7-Email Sequence

---

#### Auto Email 1: Introduction

**Subject:** Are you losing $3K/month in after-hours towing calls?

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Business Name] offers towing services, and I had a quick question:

What happens when someone calls at 11 PM with a breakdown?

If you're like most shops we talk to, those calls either:
- Go to voicemail (and the customer calls the next shop)
- Go to your personal cell (and you never get a break)
- Go to an answering service (that just takes messages)

**The Average Auto Shop Loses $2,000-5,000/month This Way**

We've built an AI phone assistant specifically for auto shops that:
- Answers 24/7 with natural conversation
- Collects breakdown location and details
- Dispatches your tow truck automatically
- Sends you SMS with all the info
- Captures revenue you're missing now

ABC Auto Shop in [Nearby City] captured $8,200 in after-hours towing in their first 90 days.

**Want to see how it works?**

Call our automotive demo: (555) 123-4567

Or schedule a quick call: [Calendar Link]

#### Auto Email 2: Pain Point Deep-Dive (3 Days Later)

**Subject:** The real cost of your front desk answering phones all day

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Question: How much time does your front desk spend on these calls?

- "What are your hours?" (30 seconds × 15 calls/week = 7.5 min)
- "How much is an oil change?" (1 min × 12 calls/week = 12 min)
- "Can I schedule an appointment?" (5 min × 30 calls/week = 150 min)
- "Where are you located?" (45 sec × 10 calls/week = 7.5 min)

**Total: ~3 hours per week minimum**

**That's 156 hours per year = $4,000-6,000 in salary**

And that's conservative. Most shops tell us it's closer to 10 hours/week.

**But here's the bigger problem:**

Every time your receptionist is on the phone, they're not:
- Greeting customers walking in
- Handling paperwork
- Supporting your technicians
- Managing parts orders

**AI Handles These Calls Automatically**

Your front desk stays focused on in-person customers.
Phone calls get answered 24/7.
You save thousands in productivity.

**Subject:** You're at capacity—time to add a second line?

**Preview Text:** Busy signals mean lost customers

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Great problem to have: Your AI phone assistant is getting so many calls that you're starting to hit capacity limits.

**Here's What We're Seeing:**

Last week, you had:
- [X] times when all lines were busy
- [X] calls that couldn't get through

**The Solution:**

Add a second concurrent line for just $150/month.
