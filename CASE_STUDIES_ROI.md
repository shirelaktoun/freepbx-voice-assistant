## Automotive Case Study

### ABC Auto Repair: Capturing $8,200 in After-Hours Towing Revenue

---

**Company Overview:**

**Business Name:** ABC Auto Repair
**Location:** Columbus, Ohio
**Industry:** Automotive Repair & Towing
**Employees:** 12 (4 technicians, 2 service advisors, 1 receptionist, 1 office manager, 4 tow truck operators)
**Annual Revenue:** $1.2M
**Services:** Full-service auto repair, diagnostics, towing, roadside assistance
**Years in Business:** 14
**Locations:** 2

**Business Profile:**
ABC Auto Repair is a family-owned full-service automotive repair shop serving Columbus and surrounding areas. They've built a reputation for honest work and fair prices, maintaining a 4.7-star rating across 600+ reviews. They handle everything from oil changes to complex diagnostics, and operate a small towing division with 4 trucks.

---

**The Challenge:**

**Primary Pain Points:**

**1. Lost After-Hours Revenue ($36K+/Year)**
- Business hours: Monday-Friday 7 AM - 6 PM, Saturday 8 AM - 2 PM
- Closed Sunday and all evenings
- Estimated 60-70 towing calls per month after hours
- Owner Mike's personal cell received some calls, but he couldn't answer 24/7
- No way to dispatch tow trucks when office was closed
- Competitors with 24/7 answering services were capturing this business
- **Estimated annual loss: $36,000-48,000**

**2. Morning Rush Overwhelm**
- Peak call times: 7-9 AM (customers calling before work)
- Single receptionist handling 40-50 calls during this window
- Customers experiencing 3-5 minute hold times
- Walk-in customers being neglected
- Some calls going to voicemail even during business hours
- **Estimated 15-20 lost appointments per month**

**3. Repetitive Questions Consuming Staff Time**
- "What are your hours?" (15-20x per week)
- "How much is [basic service]?" (30-40x per week)
- "Where are you located?" (10-15x per week)
- "Do you do [type of work]?" (20-30x per week)
- **Estimated 10-12 hours per week of staff time on routine questions**

**4. Competitive Disadvantage**
- Larger dealers offered 24/7 phone coverage
- National chains had robust phone systems
- ABC was losing potential customers who called after hours
- Google reviews mentioned difficulty reaching them

**Quote from Owner:**
> "We're a great shop, but if customers can't reach us, they go somewhere else. I was getting towing calls on my personal cell at 2 AM, and I couldn't answer them all. We were literally leaving money on the table every single night."
>
> **- Mike Thompson, Owner**

---

**The Solution:**

**Decision Process:**
Mike researched several options:
1. Hiring night staff (too expensive - $40K+ per year)
2. Traditional answering service (just took messages, didn't solve problem)
3. IVR system (customers hated robotic menus)
4. AI phone assistant (new technology, worth testing)

**Why FreePBX Voice Assistant:**
- Natural conversation (not robotic IVR)
- Actually took action (not just messages)
- Self-hosted (data privacy)
- Integrated with existing FreePBX system (no rip-and-replace)
- Affordable ($497/month vs. $3,000+ for answering service)
- 30-day money-back guarantee (low risk)

**Plan Selected:** Professional Plan ($497/month)
- 3 concurrent phone lines

**Customer Quotes:**

**Mike Thompson, Owner:**
> "I was skeptical at first. How could AI really handle customer calls? But after the first week, I was blown away. Customers don't even realize they're talking to AI - they think we hired someone. The AI paid for itself in the first week, and we're now capturing towing calls at 2 AM, 3 AM, whenever. Revenue we used to completely miss."

**Jennifer, Office Manager:**
> "The morning rush used to be chaos. I'd be on the phone non-stop from 7 to 9, and walk-in customers would be standing there waiting. Now the AI handles most of those calls, and I can actually greet people when they walk in. It's been a game-changer for my stress level."

**Sarah, Service Advisor:**
> "I love that I only get transferred the calls that actually need me. No more 'what are your hours?' interruptions. When a call comes to me, I know it's something important that needs human attention."

## ROI Calculator Guide

### How to Calculate Your ROI

**Step 1: Calculate Lost Revenue from Missed Calls**

```
Formula:
Missed Calls/Month × Conversion Rate × Average Sale Value = Lost Revenue

Example:
40 missed calls × 40% conversion × $150 = $2,400/month
```

**Variables:**
- **Missed Calls:** Estimate based on calls to voicemail, busy signals, or peak time estimates
- **Conversion Rate:** Industry average 30-50%; be conservative with 40%
- **Average Sale Value:** Your typical transaction value

---

**Step 2: Calculate Staff Time Savings**

```
Formula:
(Hours saved per week) × (Hourly staff cost) × 4.33 weeks = Monthly Value

Example:
10 hours × $24/hour × 4.33 = $1,039/month
```

**How to Estimate Hours Saved:**
- Count routine calls that AI would handle
- Average 2-3 minutes per routine call
- Multiply by number of routine calls per week

---

**Step 3: Calculate Total Monthly Benefit**

```
Formula:
Lost Revenue Captured + Staff Time Savings = Total Monthly Benefit

Example:
$2,400 + $1,039 = $3,439/month
```

---

**Step 4: Calculate ROI**

```
Formula:
(Total Monthly Benefit - AI System Cost) ÷ AI System Cost = ROI

Example:
($3,439 - $497) ÷ $497 = 5.9x ROI
```

---

**Step 5: Calculate Payback Period**

```
Formula:
AI System Cost ÷ (Total Monthly Benefit ÷ 30 days) = Days to Payback

Example:
$497 ÷ ($3,439 ÷ 30) = 4.3 days
```
